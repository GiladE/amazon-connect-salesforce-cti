# Configuring and Using AWS Serverless Application Repository for Salesforce Features

The AWS Serverless Application Repository for Salesforce includes a
number of features that are enabled by default, however they are only
activated as you need them or as you configure them. Some of these
features can be configured to execute on a call by call basis, while
others are set to execute periodically, such as historic report data
import.
