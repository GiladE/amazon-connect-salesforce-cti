Installation
============

The Amazon Connect integration with Salesforce consists of two
components: The CTI Adapter Managed Package, which is available at no
cost in the AppExchange Marketplace, and the AWS Serverless application
package for Salesforce, which provides additional features beyond the
baseline CTI integration.
