<h2 class="toc">Recording Controls</h2>

Recording Controls panel in the CCP Overlay allows your agents to control the recording behavior of the call.

This can be useful when you don't want to record every call, and give the agent the ability to pause and resume a recording.

Note that once a recording is stopped, it cannot be restarted. After starting a recording, you should use pause/resume button to control it.
