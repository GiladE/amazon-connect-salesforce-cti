<h1 class="toc">Appendix B - Configuring Salesforce as Your Identity Provider</h1>

Amazon Connect supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) to
enable single sign on(SSO). Salesforce can act as a single sign on
identity provider to service providers, allowing end users to easily and
securely access many web and mobile applications with one login. By
establishing the SSO integration between Amazon Connect and Salesforce,
you will be able to seamlessly login to Salesforce and the same
credentials will be used to auto-login to Amazon Connect.
